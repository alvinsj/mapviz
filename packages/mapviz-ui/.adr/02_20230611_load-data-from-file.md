# Load data from file

## Status

poc

## Context

In the beginning of finding out what works for a mapviz, geojson data is needed to view on the map.

## Decision

Loading a map layer from an file input seems like an easy way to do it, rather than setting up databases of different geojson.
Also adding some immediate available data list to load.

## Consequences

Pros
- it's easier now to load a map layer from a geojson file on the computer

Cons
- it's unclear if this is a feature needed next
